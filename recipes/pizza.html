	<p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>

		<li>Spread an even layer of tomato sauce onto the cut sides of each ciabatta roll. Sprinkle equal amounts of garlic and oregano onto each roll. Place 2 salami slices side by side onto each roll; top each with 2 slices ham. Divide red onion, mushrooms, red pepper, olives, and basil between the 4 sandwiches and spread evenly atop the meats. Finish by topping with provolone cheese and sandwiching roll halves around the fillings.</li>
